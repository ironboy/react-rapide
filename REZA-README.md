Hi Reza!

TO DO:
* This should install a little differenlty than other examples, not replacing the source folder or public folder entirely... rather just giving you the files you need.
* Integration of the data (currently JSON files only) into a backend similar to the one in our REST-api / shopping cart examples to be used in latter stages of the assignment.
